Due to a long-standing unresolved Debian bug report, GNU Make remained the age-old 4.81 in Debian for a very long time, and as a consequence, in Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu and Mint.

The latest Debian release, Jessie, has upgraded to 4.0, so Debian-based distributions will have that upgrade. However, it is better to use 4.1.

This has been discussed many times on the GNU Make mailing list and elsewhere.

So to get a newer version, you must compile it from scratch. This is easy:

Install the required packages (gcc, make and such).
Open up a shell (if you're using the GUI, a terminal window).
Type the following commands (or something equivalent, e.g. you can use curl instead of wget):

cd /tmp
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-4.10.tar.gz
tar xvf make-4.10.tar.gz
cd make-4.10/
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
rm -rf make-4.10.tar.gz make-4.10
Now, make 4.10 is in /usr/local/bin/make.

You can verify it is there with whereis make.

You can make it your default make by prefixing /usr/local/bin to your $PATH variable in your shell startup file; for instance, in .profile or .bashrc if you use the bash shell.

Don't try to install a self-compiled make (or anything else that doesn't come from the distribution's package manager) into /bin or /usr/bin; doing that will confuse your package manager.
