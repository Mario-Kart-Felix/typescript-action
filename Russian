Every single morning the Russian Federation keeps attacking our sites. Every single day I block their IP address and every single day they use a new sub net. I tried:

-A INPUT -s 4.53.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 173.205.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 37.9.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 213.180.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 5.255.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 141.8.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 87.250.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 178.154.0.0/16 -j DROP
-A INPUT -s 5.45.0.0/16 -j DROP
